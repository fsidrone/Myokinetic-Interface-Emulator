# Myokinetic-Interface-Emulator
This project was developed to move magnets in a way that emulates human hand movement patterns, with the purpose of collecting a dataset for training and validating machine learning models for Myokinetic Interface research.
acquisitonUnit files contains code that collect sensor datas and send to FPGA to save through ILA.
controlUnit files contains code that implements magnets moviments according user input.
